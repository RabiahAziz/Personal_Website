    <p class="margin">I designed a personality quiz that decides if you are a Monster High doll or a Bratz doll. This helps determine your fashion style, preferences, and personality!</p>
<h2>Activist Website</h2>
<a href="https://26d9586a-2add-44b8-91a3-1a949901aabc-00-6vh9oiykl3pr.global.replit.dev/"> <img src="assets/activist website.png"alt="This is a screenshot of my activist website on fast-fashion and its effects on society."height="50%"width="50%"></a>
    <p class="margin"> I researched fast-fashion, specifically its effect on women and the environment. Labor is outsourced to developing countries, like Bangladesh. The workers aren't paid a living wage and the working conditions are unsafe. This needs to change.
